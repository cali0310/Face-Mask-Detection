Real-time Face Mask Detection for ASSIGNMENT 1

This project is a real-time face mask detection system using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. The program captures video from a webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier, and classifies them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask" using a pre-trained deep learning model.

Prerequisites:

- Python installed on your machine.

- Required Python libraries: cv2, tensorflow, numpy.

- Download the pre-trained model and haarcascade classifier from the internet, or use the provided files.
